Algorithms
There are the 3 basic ones bubbleSort, selectionSort and insertioSort.

Have added a fourth one, doubleSort.
This is my take on on improving upon bubbleSort.
Have verified and it performs better than both Selection and Insertion.
And the performance gets better with increase in the dataset.
